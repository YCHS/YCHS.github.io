<h1>The kingdom of Husky:</h1>
<p>The Kingsman agents venture stateside in the film franchise's sequel The Golden Circle, where they meet Stetson-wearing spies like Whiskey and Tequila, played by Messrs Pedro Garcia and Channing Tatum, respectively. Styles like this plush shearling jacket capture the film's American spirit perfectly.<em>It's been carefully made in the UK from panels of supple beige hide and trimmed with rugged strips of leather. The bomber profile looks best with authentic indigo denim.</em>Shown here with: Kingsman shirt, Kingsman boots.</p>
